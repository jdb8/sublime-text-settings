sublime-text-settings
=====================

A repo to store my settings for Sublime Text (2) for the purposes of cross-machine sync and versioning.

Instructions for install
========================

* Navigate to the Packages folder (can be found by clicking Preferences > Browse Packages)
* Open a Terminal, backup the existing User folder with ''''mv User User-backup''''
* Clone this repo into the User folder

**Notes**: ST gets a bit weird until you install Package Control and the theme being used - probably best to install those manually first.
